This page will be documented as a readme for our project as we progress.

# Ideas
- [ ] It's possible to read remote pdfs with lanchain's unstructured document loader. So remote document functionality?
- [ ] Retrievers needn't rely on vector stores, consider using something different if vector db isn't serving up accurate documents.
- [ ] Self querying can be added if you can figure out some good metadata for research papers.
