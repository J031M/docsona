### stage 1: System Requirements & Analysis
#### Identify User Requirements:
Understand the needs of the end-users, such as supported document formats (PDF, Word, plain text), search functionality by title, author, or keywords, and expectations from the document summarization process.

#### Technical Requirements Analysis:
Evaluate the technical aspects like server requirements, necessary APIs, languages to be used, database management, and others.

### Stage 2: System Design
#### Designing User Interface (UI): 
Design a user-friendly UI for uploading documents, displaying summaries, and enabling users to interact with the documents.

#### Designing System Architecture: 
Design the overall system architecture, incorporating elements like the document upload module, search functionality, summary generation, and the document interaction interface.

### Stage 3:  Implementation & Integration
#### Implementing Document Upload Module: 
Develop a functionality to upload documents in various formats, integrating with necessary APIs and libraries.

#### Implementing Search Functionality:
Develop algorithms for indexing and searching documents based on title, author, or keywords.

#### Implementing Summary Generation:
Implement algorithms for processing documents and extracting key information to create concise summaries. We will leverage transformer models and LangChain for this purpose. The implementation will have two key phases: Ingestion, where we vectorize the chunks of text into embeddings and store them in a vector database, and Generation, where we take the user query, embed it similarly, and generate a relevant summary.

#### Integrating User Interface: 
Integrate the developed user interface with the back-end functionalities developed. This will display the generated summaries, including the title, author, and main points of the document.

#### Implementing Document Interaction Interface: 
Develop an interface to communicate with a document as if it was a person. This will be achieved by leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

### Stage 4: Testing & Validation
#### System Testing: 
Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues in the system. This will include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

#### Validation: 
Ensure that the system meets the user requirements identified in Stage 1. This could involve user surveys or beta testing with a subset of users.

### Stage 5: Deployment & Maintenance
#### Deployment: 
After successful testing and validation, the system will be deployed for end-users.
